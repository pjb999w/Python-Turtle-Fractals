# Python-Turtle-Fractals
Creating recursive fractals with Turtle.py

Square: I used what I learned from the snowflake to create a function that called a previous function. This allowed me to repeat my fractal to make a square. I wanted to make a fractal that made larger squares look like they were stacked on top of smaller squares.

Circle: My intention was to create a fractal that made smaller circles look like they were contained within larger circles. After creating the first circle, similar instructions given twice created the layers of inner circles.

The canvas frame was brought into the same application as the turtle generator. This was followed by labelling the control panel. An information panel was placed beneath the control panel to show the orders that were being carried out on screen. Black was made the background colour for the root in order to make the panels stand out. The labels on the canvas frame and the information panel were coloured red to make the headings apparent. The information panel was given a light green background with the text in red for the sake of readability.
